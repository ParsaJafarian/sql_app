# sql_app
This is my little project that is designed with the goal of reassessing my knowledge in MySql and back-end web development.

## Description
This app is a simple sign up page for a newsletter that asks for an email. The email is then posted to the express server which stores that email inside a MySql database. 

## How to run
1. Clone the repository
2. Go to the MySql shell
3. Run `SOURCE <path to createDB.sql>` to create the database
4. Run `SOURCE <path to users.sql>` to create the table
5. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
6. Run `npm start` to start the server
7. Go to `localhost:3000` to view the app
